												<h2><a href="#">Hi, can I introduce myself?</a></h2>
											</header>
											<p> I am a woman in my 30s with a fresh graduated PhD degree and a job in Tech. Besides my current job,
												I have never worked on a full-time job before. Start my career at 30s seems a little
												late. Thus, I am a little clueless about my career, including the social dynamic,
												the career path, and the technics. This is a new world that I have to explore.
											</p>

											<p> I am single now. I have had 5 relationships, including one that never kissed 
												(you are right, its one-side), one that only lasts a month, and three normal ones. Being 
												single again makes me notice that I have never understanding the underlying truth of relationship.
												This is a new game that I need to play.
											</p>

											<p> I love pursuing healthy life style, because I terrified by hostpital (one of 
												my ex studies medicine). If there is one special interests that I have, that is my passion
												for well-being. I would love to share my experience and knowledge on this topic.
											</p> 

											<p> I am average smart, but I have a lot of smart friends, which makes me feel lucky. 
											</p>

											<p> I am good at taking actions, but I am relatively bad at thinking and analyzing. 
											</p>

											<p> I can be tolerant and understanding, but I am not that sensitive.
											</p>

											<p> All in all, I believe in the possibility to impact my own fate, if I step out of 
												comfort zone and take actions.
