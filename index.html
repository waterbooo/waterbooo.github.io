												<h2><a href="#">Hi, can I introduce myself?</a></h2>
											</header>
											<p> I am a woman in my 30s with a fresh graduated PhD degree. Besides my current job,
												I have never worked in a full-time job before. Start my career at 30s seems a little
												late now. I feel I am a little clueless about my career. The job, the type, and the social
												relationship. This is a new world that I need to explore.
											</p>

											<p> I am single now. I have had 5 relationships, including one that never kissed 
												(you are right, its one-side), one that only lasts a month, and three normal ones. Being 
												single again makes me notice that I have never understanding the underlying truth of relationship.
												This is a new game that I need to play. 
											</p>

											<p> I love seeking for healthy life style, because I terrified by hostpital, especially one of 
												my ex studies medicine. I think if there is one special interests that I have, that is my passion
												for well-being. This is something that I can share my experience and knowledge about.
											</p> 

											<p> I am not smart, but I have a lot of smart friends, whom I really cherish. 
											</p>

											<p> I am a good at taking actions, but I am relatively bad at thinking and analyzing. 
											</p>

											<p> I can be tolerant a lot, but I am not sensitive enough.
											</p>

											<p> I believe in the possibility to impact my own fate, if I step out of comfort zone and
												 take actions.
											</p>
