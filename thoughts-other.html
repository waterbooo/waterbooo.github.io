								<h2>Some Thoughts on Bad Blood </h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3> 2.22.2023</h3>
							<p>Bad Blood is really a gripping book, I can't put my eye off once I started. It has a lot of "gossips"
							to intrigue me, and in the meantime, some aspects brought from the story is totally new for me.</p>
							<p>The company have so much powers than a normal people. When Therano wants to fight the Fuizs family,
							even Fuizs family is already really rich, but they still have to call of the stop court war, because it
							can bankrupt them. Nevertheless the ex-employees who want to telling the truth. In this cases, Lawyer
							can really be a strong weapon while normal people can't afford.</p>
							<p>With such big power, regulation is really important, so that the company can't abuse their power.
							The jounalist can win the war because they use the power from the goverment regulator - FDA, the CMS -
							I can't imagine what will be the ending if this happens in China, since corraption is everywhere. The jounalist
							will have no means to win the war, and more likely just a happy ending between Therano and government.
							This is also a reason that Chinese medical inovation has limited progress. The corruption between people in 
							upper classes, and no regulation can be the killing bed for innocation.</p>
							
							<p>This book also shows how important (or just how) people value the network, especially in the upper class.
							Why Therano can trick and get money from the smartest people? Because they believed in people in their circles.
							Once Elithebath got the pass from one or two people in the circle (Professor Channing, VC Don Lucas, etc),
							she had her way and people immidiately trust her, her word and her work.</p>
							<p>As a nobody, I just instantly related with the passed-away scientist Ian, and the bad-luck lawyer John Fuizs.
							It's not surprise that power can distort the truth, fair, but it's still very threathening when I read it, and
							feel the potential this can also happen to be. Just like the lay-offs. With a bit of unluck, any the bad things 
							can happen. And the book shows some new examples.</p>
							<p>Overall, I think this might be a very first book I really closely about a single company. It opened my eye.
							I would hardly imagine how many hands the leadership can play - bluff, threathening are just some typical means
							to achieve some of their goals. But I guess this still makes sense to me, language is an afforable weapon they have.</p>
