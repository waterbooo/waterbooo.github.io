								<h2>Machine learning system</h2>

							<h3>Not only ML alforithm matters</h3>
							<p>Lately, I was reading a book called "Machine Learning system design", it is very inspiring, since it totally opened my eye for the entire
							ML system. There are so many parts that are all very important in production, while in school I was only learnt the algorithm part. This makes
							sense because in school, the work of professors is usully theoritical, the latency/user experience is not really needed to be considered. 
							In real-word, how to handle large amount of data, how to makes the data transfer with durable latency, how to make model deploy smoothly,
							how to fix model problem when it is in the production, how to prevent large scale model from regression when many engineer work on it in 
							the same time, how to handle data shift problem... Those are all the real challenge that school can't teach. </p>
							<p>Therefore, as an eval engineer, now I think myself as part of the ML pipeline, rather than just a software engineer who define metrics, 
							working on clean data. I think ML model still very cool, however, the past 5 years Tansformer has dominate the market. To have a more revolutionary
							model is really challenging. I think the importance/impact difference is small now between doing the algorithm part and doing the rest in ML system.
